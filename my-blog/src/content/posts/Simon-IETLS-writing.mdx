**The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.**

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</font>**

It is clear that **nuclear power** was **by far** the most important **means of electricity generation** over the period shown. **Renewables** provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the lines</font>**

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 3</font>**

**<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">In 1980</font>**, the **thermal power** stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. **Nuclear and hydroelectric power** stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and **renewables** provided a negligible amount. Just **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">one year later</font>**, nuclear power **<font style="color:#74B602;">overtook</font>** thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 4</font>**

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">nuclear power</font>** rose dramatically to **peak** of 430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, the figure for **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">thermal power</font>** **fell** to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period. **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">Hydroelectric</font>**<font style="color:#DF2A3F;"> </font>**<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">power</font>** generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period,**but** **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">renewable electrictiy</font>** production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.

The bar chart compares the number of mobile phones sold worldwide by the five most popular manufacturers in the years 2009, 2011 and 2013.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</font>**

It is clear that Nokia sold the most mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became the best selling brand in 2013. Samsung and Apple saw the biggest rises in sales over 5-year period.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the bars</font>**

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 3: comparisions, </font>** **<u><font style="color:#117CEE;">changes over time</font></u>**

In 2009, <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">Nokia</font> sold close to 450 million mobile phones, which was <font style="color:#74B602;">almost double </font>the number of handsets sold by the <font style="color:#74B602;">second most successful</font> manufacturer, <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">Samsung</font>. <u> Over the following four years, however, <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">Nokia's</font></u><u> sales figures fell by approximately 200 million units, <font style="color:#74B602;">whereas</font></u><u> <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">Samsung</font></u><u> saw sales rise by a similar amount</u>. By 2013, <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">Samsung</font> <font style="color:#74B602;">had become the market leader</font> with sales reaching 450 units.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 4: comparisions, </font>** **<u><font style="color:#117CEE;">changes over time</font></u>**

The other three top selling moblie phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">LG, ZTE and Apple</font>. In 2009, <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">these companies sold</font> around 125 million, 50 million and 25 million mobile handsets <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">respectively</font>,  but <font style="color:#DF2A3F;">Apple </font><u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">overtook the other two vendors</font></u><u> in 2011.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Introduction - paraphrase the question</font>**

The pie charts compare five categories of household expenditure and the UK and New Zealand in the years 1980 and 2008.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</font>**

It is noticeable that the proportion of spending on food and drink fell in both countries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills rose. Also, UK residents spent a significantly larger percentage of their household budgets on leisure than their New Zealand counterparts.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 3    </font>** **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">2 categories</font>**

In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household budget went on <u>food and drink</u>, while the equivalent figure for a UK home was 23%. By 2008, expenditure on food and drink had fallen by 4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. By contrast, both countries saw an increase in expenditure on <u>utility bill</u> for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 4   </font>** **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">3 categories</font>**

<u>Leisure</u> activities accounted for the highest proportion of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zealanders spent only half as much in relative terms on <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">recreation</font></u> (17%) as UK residents (34%). In both countries, <u>transport</u> costs and <u>other</u> costs took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets respectively.

The table compares the five highest ranking countries in terms of the numbers of visits and the money spent by tourists over a period of two years.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</font>**

It is clear that France was the world's most popular tourist destination in the years 2012 and 2013. However, the USA earned by far the most revenue from  tourism over the same period.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 3</font>**

In <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">2012</font></u>, 83 million tourists visited France, and the USA was the second most visited country, with 66.7 million tourists. Spain and China each received just under 58 million visitors, while Italy was ranked fifth with 46.4 million tourists. <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">2013</font></u> saw a rise of between 1 and 4 million tourist visits to each country, with the exception of China, which received 2 million fewer visitors than in the previous year.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 4   </font>** **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">3 sentences</font>**

Spending by tourists visiting the USA increased from $126.2 billion in 2012 to $139.6 billion in 2013, and these figures were well over twice as high as those for any other country. Spain received the second highest amounts of tourist revenue, rising from $56.3 billion to $60.4 billion, followed by France, China and Italy. Interestingly, despite falling numbers of tourists, Chinese revenue from tourism rose by $1.7 billion in 2013.

The bar chart compares the numbers of men and women who took four different evening classes in 2009, and the pie chart shows the age profile of these attendees.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</font>**

It is clear that significantly more women than men attended evening classes at the education centre. We can also see that evening courses were much more popular among older adults.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 3</font>**

According to the <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">bar chart</font>, <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">drama, painting</font></u> and <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">language</font></u> courses all attracted <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">more women than men</font> to the education centre in 2009. Language classes had the highest number of participants overall, with <u>40 female and 20 male</u> students, while painting was a popular choice among <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">both genders</font>, attracting <u>30 female and 25 male</u> attendees. The only course with a higher number of males was <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">sculpture</font></u>, but this course was taken by a mere <u>15 people in total</u>.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 4</font>**

Looking at the age profile pie chart, we can see that <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">the majority</font> of people attending evening lessons were <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">over 40 years of age</font></u>. To be precise, <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">42%</font> of them were aged <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">50 or more</font></u>, and <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">26%</font> were aged <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">between 40 and 49</font></u>.

The first flow diagram illustrates the process of glass container production, and the second diagram shows step in the process of recycling used glass.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</font>**

We can see that glass is made using three main raw materials, and that the manufacturing process consists of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 3</font>**

<u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">At the first stage in</font></u> the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">are mixed</font> together. <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">Next</font></u>, this mixture <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">is heated</font> in a glass furnace at approximately 1500°C to produce molten glass. The molten glass <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">can</font> <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">then</font></u> <font style="background-color:#FBDE28;">be shaped</font>, by blowing, to create the <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">end products</font></u>, namely glass containers.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 4</font>**

Glass recycling <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">begins with</font></u> the <u><font style="color:#117CEE;">collection</font></u> of used glass products. <u><font style="color:#117CEE;">The collected glass</font></u> is sorted according to its colour, <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">and then</font></u> washed in order to remove any impurities. <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">At the fourth stage</font></u> of recycling, the glass is crushed and <u><font style="color:#117CEE;">melted</font></u>, and <u><font style="color:#117CEE;">the resulting molten glass</font></u> can <u><font style="color:#DF2A3F;">finally</font></u> be molded to create new items.

The two pictures compare the current layout of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the same living space.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</font>**

We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 3</font>**

The most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current staircase and understair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.

**<font style="color:#117CEE;">Paragraph 4</font>**

To replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.
